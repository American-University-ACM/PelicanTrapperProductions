READ ME:

This is a small, sloppy web project I did to teach myself some JS, CSS, and HTML. It is based on a friend's web needs (he's a professional magician). It is not being hosted (and I doubt it ever will be). 

To open and navigate the site in your browser, simply download all of the repository's files into a single folder, then open "home.html" in your preferred internet browser. 

If you want to know anything else about this project, feel free to contact me via my github account!

Thanks!
